	<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>The expected cost to the 2012-13 &amp; 2013-14 budgets of several recently announced and fiscally significant policy changes have not been quantified by the current government.</p>
<p> These include changes to <a href='http://budgetaus.net/scheme_results.php?scheme=schools' target='_blank'>schools</a> funding from the Gonski Review, changes to <a href='http://budgetaus.net/scheme_results.php?scheme=refugee' target='_blank'>refugee</a> policies and the <a href='http://budgetaus.net/program_results.php?program=%225.6%20National%20Disability%20Insurance%20Scheme%22' target='_blank'>National Disability Insurance Scheme</a>. </p>

<p>
None of the updated figures for these policies were provided in the recently announced <a href='http://www.budget.gov.au/2012-13/content/myefo/html/index.htm' target='_blank'>MYEFO</a> and the government do not appear to be willing to provide these figures prior to the 2013 May budget.</p>
<p> Please keep in mind that BudgetAus can only publish and calculate data that has been publicly announced by the government and so the veracity of conclusions that can be drawn based on the information in the database will only be as accurate as the governments own announcements allow.</p>
