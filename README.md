The working version of BudgetAus is online at http://infoaus.net/budget/index.php

The public working version of the code at this address may not match the code in the repository as changes have not been pushed to the server.
Please note that for 'last' year's budget figures (figures published on budget night 2012) there are only figures for 2011-12 and 2012-13 and no forward funding years.
