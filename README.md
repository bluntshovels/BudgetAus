The working version of BudgetAus is online at http://infoaus.net/budget/index.php

Head over to the GitHub Wiki for existing documentation https://github.com/forkinthecode/BudgetAus/wiki

Find budget_table at http://infoaus.net/budget_table.csv (2012-13) Last
Find budget_table2 at http://infoaus.net/budget_table2.csv (2013-14) Current

These files will be renamed after budget night (Tue May 13) when budget_table2 will become budget_table.csv and the new table with 2014-15 data will become budget_table2.csv

The public working version of the code at this address may not match the code in the repository as pushing to Git does not push to the server.

Please note that for 'last' year's budget figures (figures published on budget night 2012) there are only figures for 2011-12 and 2012-13 and no forward funding years.
